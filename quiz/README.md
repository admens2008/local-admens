Python Quiz Project
Overview
This Python project is a simple command-line quiz application. The quiz presents multiple-choice questions to the user, provides feedback on whether the answers are correct, and displays the user's score at the end. The project is organized into two files: questions.py and run_quiz.py.

Features
Multiple-choice questions
Case-insensitive answer checking
Score tracking
Feedback messages based on the user's score
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
Running the Quiz
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the source code is located.
Run the script using Python:

python run_quiz.py
Project Structure
questions.py: Contains the list of quiz questions.
run_quiz.py: Contains the logic to run the quiz.

How It Works
The quiz questions are defined in questions.py as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a question, a list of choices, and the correct answer.
The run_quiz.py script imports the quiz questions and runs the quiz.
The script iterates through each question, displaying it along with its choices.
The user types their answer, which is checked against the correct answer.
Feedback is provided for each question, and the user's score is updated accordingly.
At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed along with a final message based on the score.

Example:
What is the capital of France?
1. Paris
2. London
3. Berlin
4. Madrid
Type your answer: Paris
That's correct!

What is the largest country in the world?
1. Canada
2. Russia
3. China
4. USA
Type your answer: Russia
That's correct!

Your score is 2 out of 2
Congratulations!

Customization
To add more questions, modify the quiz list in the questions.py file. Each question should follow the same structure:


quiz = [
    {"question": "Your question here",
     "choices": ["Choice1", "Choice2", "Choice3", "Choice4"],
     "answer": "CorrectAnswer"
    },
    ...
]
